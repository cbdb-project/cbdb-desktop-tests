"""The registry the report is written from -- and nothing else.

This module holds one round's findings **for as long as it takes to
write that round's report**.  It is not a record of what this project
has ever found, it is not consulted to decide whether a test may fail,
and it carries nothing from one run to the next.  Each round starts
empty, the round's own evidence fills it, ``reports/generate_report.py``
turns it plus that run's JSON into the English and Chinese reports, and
the next round starts empty again.

Why so narrow.  A registry that persists becomes an expectation: once a
finding is written down, a marker somewhere says "this test may fail
because of entry X", and from then on the suite is measuring the
registry rather than the build.  Two consequences, both paid for here:
a defect quietly stays tolerated long after anyone agreed to tolerate
it, and a *fresh* assessment of a new distribution is impossible
because the agent doing it starts by reading last round's nine
findings.  The git history of this file is the only history worth
having; ``git log -p`` is where to look for it, deliberately not the
working copy.

What replaces it, for the one case where persistence is legitimate --
"we discussed this and agreed to leave it for now" -- is
``cbdb_desktop/waivers.py``: an optional table, outside the suite,
addressed by the **program's own names** (a test function, plus the
parametrisation ids it ran with) because no identifier this suite
invents survives a stateless round.  It is dated, bilingual, printed in
the report, and absent unless someone configures ``CBDB_WAIVERS``.

So a defect is detected the same way it always was -- the test confirms
an exact signature and raises :class:`KnownShippedDefect`, which is an
``AssertionError`` and therefore an ordinary failure with the signature
in its message.  Nothing in this file makes that failure expected.

``PRIORITIES`` and ``ORIGINS`` below are not per-round state: they are
the vocabulary the report is written in, and ``origin`` in particular
decides *who a finding is sent to* -- see AGENTS.md § "Where a defect
comes from".  A problem in the data arriving from the CBDB source is
not one the application developers can fix, and sending it to them
wastes the one channel this project has.
